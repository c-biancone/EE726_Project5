   abstract = {A CMOS switched-capacitor reference is combined with a switched-capacitor voltage doubling charge pump to produce a compact regulated 3.2-V power supply from an input that ranges from 1.8 to 3.5 V. It can supply up to 6 mA at minimum input. The switched-capacitor topology uses a single PN junction and could allow for inputs and outputs less than 1 V. The concept of constant frequency charge pump regulation is discussed, as is the theory behind stability, load regulation, and efficiency. Measured results from a 0.5-μm CMOS process are given. © 2006 IEEE.},

   abstract = {Charge pump circuits can be used to generate floating power supplies for the high side circuitry of half-bridge inverters. Because of its small input to output voltage drop, the charge pump circuit supports a wide range of supply voltages and is ideal for powering high side circuitry with low voltage requirements. A model for the operation of the charge pump is derived, which offers an improvement over previous models by accounting for the effect of a load current and which includes a variable pump oscillator duty term and current dependent diode models to allow for a more accurate prediction of the charge pump behavior. More importantly, the model also predicts the critical effects of switching transients at the output of the half-bridge on the charge pump. The model has been verified against experiments and shows a good agreement. Using the model, a charge pump circuit was designed for use as the high side power supply for a typical half-bridge inverter.},

   abstract = {— A simple cascode circuit with the gate voltage of the cascode transistor being controlled by a feedback amplifier, and thus named a “regulated cascode,” is presented. In comparison to the standard cascode circuit, the minimum output voltage is lower by about 30 to 60 percent while the output conductance and the feedback capacitance are lower by about 100 times. An analytical large-signal, small-signal, and noise analysis is carried out. Some applications like current mirrors and voltage amplifiers are discussed. Finally, experimental results confirming the theory are presented. © 1990 IEEE},

   abstract = {This paper describes design techniques to maximize the efficiency and power density of fully integrated switched-capacitor (SC) DC-DC converters. Circuit design methods are proposed to enable simplified gate drivers while supporting multiple topologies (and hence output voltages). These methods are verified by a proof-of-concept converter prototype implemented in 0.374 mm2 of a 32 nm SOI process. The 32-phase interleaved converter can be configured into three topologies to support output voltages of 0.5 V-1.2 V from a 2 V input supply, and achieves 79.76% efficiency at an output power density of 0.86 W/mm2. © 2011 IEEE.},

@article{Qiang2009,
   abstract = {In order to improve efficiency and reduce the output ripple, a novel multi-mode charge pump is presented. The proposed charge pump includes dual-loop regulation topology-skip and linear modes. It consumes low quiescent current in skip mode for light loads, and produces low ripple in linear mode for heavy loads, which closes the gap between linear mode and skip mode with active regulation; a multi-mode charge pump employing the technique has been implemented in the UMC 0.6-μm-BCD process. The results indicate that the charge pump works well and effectively; it has low ripple with special regulation, and minimizes the size of the capacitance, then decreases the area of the PCB board. The adjustable output of the positive charge pump is 10-30 V, and the maximum output ripple is 100 mV when the load current is 200 mA. The line regulation is 0.2%/V, and load regulation is 0.075%. © 2009 Chinese Institute of Electronics.},

   abstract = {A modified regulated cascode structure that incorporate a push-pull inverting amplifier and having a low output compliance voltage is used in the implementations of proposed current mirrors. P-SPICE simulations in 0.25μm CMOS technology validate the proposed current mirror structures at 1V. They offer very high output impedance about 30GΩ, consume around 200μW of power at 100μA d.c. current, and offer low output compliance voltage of 0.2V. The use of a level shifter across input transistor reduces the input compliance voltage to 0.25V, this also reduces current transfer range that has been significantly improved (14nA-318μA) and input compliance voltage has been further reduced to 0.14V, when adaptive bias is employed. The proposed LVCMs can operate with sub-1V single supply. © 2010 IEEE.},
