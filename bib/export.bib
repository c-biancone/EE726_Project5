   abstract = {The linearity of charge-redistribution successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) is affected by systematic mismatch in its capacitor array. Fabrication phenomena, such as copper dishing, lead to radial gradients in the array, and the detrimental effect of these gradients cannot be mitigated by the use of common centroid layout techniques. In this work, a technique that uses the foreknowledge of radial gradients in order to shape the linearity of data converters is introduced. By choosing the order in which the capacitors within the physical array are connected during a conversion, it is possible to manipulate the converter linearity, and several integral nonlinearities (INLs) shapes can be obtained. This technique, also applicable for any ADC where the static linearity depends upon the mismatch within an array of regularly-placed circuit elements, has been successfully tested for a 10-bit SAR ADC implemented in a 180-nm CMOS process.},

   abstract = {The optimal design of SAR ADCs requires the accurate estimate of nonlinearity and parasitic effects in the feedback charge-redistribution DAC. Since the effects of both mismatch and stray capacitances depend on the specific array topology, complex calculations, custom modeling and heavy simulations in common circuit design environments are often required. This paper presents a MATLAB-based numerical tool (CSAtool) to assist the design of the charge redistribution DACs adopted in SAR ADCs. The tool performs both parametric and statistical simulations taking into account capacitive mismatch and parasitic capacitances thus computing both differential and integral nonlinearity (DNL, INL). SNDR and ENoB degradation due to static non-linear effects is also estimated. An excellent agreement is obtained with the results of circuit simulators (e.g. Cadence Spectre) featuring up to 10 4 shorter simulation time, allowing a large number statistical simulations which would be otherwise impracticable. Measurements on two fabricated SAR ADCs confirm that the proposed tool can be used as a valid instrument to assist the design of a charge redistribution SAR ADC and predict its static and dynamic metrics.},

   abstract = {This paper presents a low-power 10-bit 50-MS/s successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) that uses a monotonic capacitor switching procedure. Compared to converters that use the conventional procedure, the average switching energy and total capacitance are reduced by about 81% and 50%, respectively. In the switching procedure, the input common-mode voltage gradually converges to ground. An improved comparator diminishes the signal-dependent offset caused by the input common-mode voltage variation. The prototype was fabricated using 0.13- μm 1P8M CMOS technology. At a 1.2-V supply and 50 MS/s, the ADC achieves an SNDR of 57.0 dB and consumes 0.826 mW, resulting in a figure of merit (FOM) of 29 fJ/conversion-step. The ADC core occupies an active area of only 195 × 265 μm2. © 2010 IEEE.},

@article{Ramkaj2018,
   abstract = {This paper presents a 1.25-GS/s 7-b single-channel successive approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) that achieves a low input frequency SNDR/SFDR of 41.4/51 dB, while the SNDR/SFDR at Nyquist is 40.1/52 dB and remains still 36.4/50.1 dB at a 5-GHz input frequency (eighth Nyquist zone) without any calibration. The high and nearly constant linearity is enabled by an improved bootstrap circuit for the input switch, while the high sampling rate, the highest among recently published >34-dB SNDR single-channel SAR ADCs, is accomplished by a triple-tail dynamic comparator and a unit-switch-plus-cap (USPC) capacitive digital-to-analog converter (CDAC). To further enhance the ADC speed, the SAR logic operates in parallel to the comparator, eliminating its timing from the critical loop. The prototype chip in 28-nm bulk CMOS occupies a core area of 0.0071 mm2 and consumes 3.56 mW from a 1-V supply, leading to a Walden figure-of-merit of 34.4 fJ/conversion-step at Nyquist.},

@article{Razavi2015,
   abstract = {Field-effect transistors (FETs) have been used as switches, particularly for analog signals, since the 1950s. In the early days of analog sampling, it was discovered that such devices exhibit an input-dependent on-resistance, thereby introducing distortion. This issue can be resolved by ?bootstrapping,? a circuit technique that minimizes the switch on-resistance variation in the presence of large input and output voltage swings. In this article, we study the bootstrapped switch topology and appreciate its role in nanometer designs.},

   abstract = {This paper proposes a new dual-network bootstrapped switch, which can be used in high-speed high-resolution applications. In this switch, two parallel networks (NMOS and PMOS networks) are used to reduce the on-resistance (Ron) and the charge injection of the sampling transistor and increase the proposed switch's linearity and resolution. Simulation results show that the proposed switch achieves signal to noise and distortion ratio (SNDR) of 100.45 dB and spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) of 102.78 dB for a 10 MHz input voltage with an amplitude of 1.8 V peak-to-peak at 100 MHz sampling frequency. Furthermore, the Monte-Carlo simulations are performed in Cadence spectre, and the results show good performance of the proposed scheme in terms of linearity and resolution. Compared with the conventional switch, the proposed method increases the SNDR by 20.43% and the total harmonic distortion (THD) by 20.54%.},
